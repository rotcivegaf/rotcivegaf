# An attacker can reduce to minimum the distribution rewards

Protocol: [Thena](https://thena.fi/)
Severity: Low

## Target(s)

- [Gauge](https://bscscan.com/address/0x808cbA028c0c39c074E1eEE3E162545ADFC3256F)

## Impact(s)

- Permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Permanent freezing of funds

## Bug Description

In the **Gauge** contract the function `notifyRewardAmount` could be call by anyone
This function can called to increase `periodFinish[token]` by `DURATION = 7days` and extend the duration over which the rewards are distributed
This attack could repeated periodically and since this function can called with a low token amount and low transaction fee(BSC) this not disincentivize the attacker
And all future legitimate rewards will be low and much less will be distributed per unit of time than intended

## Impact

Anyone can call the function `notifyRewardAmount` reducing to minimum the rewards distribution

## Risk Breakdown

Difficulty to Exploit: High
Weakness: reduce distribution rewards

## Recommendation

Add a caller check to restrict the possible attacker
Only the authorized access can update reward

## Proof of Concept

In the function `notifyRewardAmount` of **Gauge** contract the `periodFinish` will be extended by `DURATION = 7 days`, and this function could be called by anyone:

`periodFinish[token] = block.timestamp + DURATION;`

`function notifyRewardAmount(address token, uint amount) external lock {`

An attacker could call this function with a low `amount` of `token`

```solidity
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish[token]) {
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            rewardRate[token] = amount / DURATION;
        } else {
            uint _remaining = periodFinish[token] - block.timestamp;
            uint _left = _remaining * rewardRate[token];
            require(amount > _left);
            _safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
            rewardRate[token] = (amount + _left) / DURATION;
        }
```

If there is no active reward period, the attacker can initiate a period with a dust amount of reward tokens
On repeated calls the else clause will require him to transfer more than what is left as current rewards but this be also dust amounts
If there is already an active period, the attacker will have to wait briefly before the reward period expires, in order for `uint left` to be sufficiently small

This affect the function `left` who is used in function `_claimFees` of **Gauge** and function `distribute` of **Voter**
